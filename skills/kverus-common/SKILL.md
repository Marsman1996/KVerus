description: Shared Rust/Verus proof references and Asterinas/VOSTD project practices for other KVerus skills. Use when Codex is repairing Verus failures, adding specifications, migrating Rust, classifying axioms or trusted boundaries, modeling external APIs, cleaning proof scaffolding, or working with Asterinas/VOSTD verification conventions.

# KVerus Common

Use this skill as a shared reference layer for KVerus tasks. It does not define a standalone repair workflow; pair it with task skills such as `kverus-fix`, `kverus-spec`, or `kverus-migrate`.

## Loading Rule

Before editing Verus code, load only the relevant reference:

- Syntax or mode confusion: read `references/verus-syntax-quickref.md`.
- Verification repair strategy or error triage: read `references/common-errors.md`.
- Proof construction, quantifiers, arithmetic, bit-vector, or SMT context issues: read the relevant file under `references/` — `proof-localization.md`, `quantifiers.md`, `solvers.md`, `arithmetic-lemmas.md`, `calc-blocks.md`, `opaque-reveal.md`, `lemma-shape.md`, or `set-reasoning.md`.
- Loop or recursive proof failures: read `references/invariants.md`.
- `ghost`, `tracked`, `Tracked<T>`, `Ghost<T>`, `@`, or erasure issues: read `references/ghost-tracked.md`.
- Axiom-like declarations, external API specifications, trusted boundaries, or proof cleanup: read `references/proof-engineering-and-trust-boundaries.md`.
- Missing or incomplete vstd specifications for `std`, `core`, or `alloc` APIs: read `references/std-external-specifications.md` together with `references/proof-engineering-and-trust-boundaries.md`.
- Asterinas/VOSTD verification commands, repository context, external-spec placement, project proof conventions, or historical examples: read `references/asterinas-vostd-practices.md` in addition to the relevant general reference.
- Concurrency, invariants, permissions, or state-machine navigation: read `references/tokenized-state-machine.md`.
- Verus-unsupported features, forced rewrites, or trait associated constant limitations: read `references/unsupported-features/index.md`, then load the relevant topic file from that directory.

## Source Path Resolution

Resolve every citation from the target workspace; never assume a machine-specific absolute path.

1. Start at the target repository root. If it contains `ostd/`, `verified_libs/`, and `tools/verus/`, treat it as the VOSTD root and `tools/verus/` as the Verus root.
2. If that layout is absent, inspect the verification command, repository scripts and configuration, and submodule metadata to locate the active Verus checkout. Accept a candidate as the Verus root only when it contains the cited `source/docs/guide/src` and `source/vstd` trees.
3. Resolve `source/docs/...`, `source/vstd/...`, and `examples/...` relative to the discovered Verus root. Resolve `ostd/...`, `verified_libs/...`, and `tools/verus/...` relative to the discovered VOSTD root.
4. Keep citations in these root-relative forms instead of resolving them against the skill directory. Confirm a cited file exists before relying on it; if no active checkout can be located, report the unresolved citation rather than inventing a path.

## Global Verus Guide Rules

Carry these rules into all KVerus skills unless the user explicitly requests a different policy:

1. Follow the active task skill's hard constraints for whether contracts, executable code, assumptions, or external bodies may be changed.
2. When the active Verus version supports it, prefer `#[verus_spec(...)]` for newly added contracts and loop annotations on executable Rust. Keep `verus!` primarily for spec/proof declarations, external specifications, and syntax that attributes cannot express.
3. Use `requires`, `ensures`, `assert`, loop invariants, and helper lemmas as the modular verification tools described by the guide.
4. Use `expr@` as the guide's shorthand for `expr.view()` when working with abstract views.
5. For loops, add invariants strong enough for entry, preservation, and exit reasoning; include surrounding facts explicitly when loop isolation requires them.
6. Use `assert(...) by (bit_vector)` for bitwise facts, `assert(...) by (compute_only)` for fully computable spec facts, and `assert(...) by (nonlinear_arith)` for nonlinear arithmetic facts.
7. Treat `#[verifier::external_body]` as a trusted verified/unverified boundary, not as an ordinary proof hint.

## Source Basis
