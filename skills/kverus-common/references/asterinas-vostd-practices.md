## Verification Gates

Use `make` as the full repository verification gate. For fast iteration on a
known OSTD module, use:

```bash
cargo dv verify --targets ostd -- -Awarnings --verify-only-module <module_path>
```

Treat targeted verification as partial feedback. Report full success only after
`make`, unless the task explicitly requested targeted-only verification or the
full gate is blocked. Preserve the exit status of `make`; do not infer success
from a shell pipeline whose last process succeeded.

For a focused target such as `path/to/file.rs::item_name`, verify the enclosing
module rather than passing the item locator to Verus. Keep edits centered on the
item and its smallest verifier-demonstrated dependency closure.

## Repository Context

- Read the target file and relevant `.rs` siblings in the same module.
- For targets under `ostd/src/`, inspect the corresponding `ostd/specs/**`
  subsystem model when it defines the same concepts.
- Inspect `crate::specs::arch::*`, `crate::specs::task::*`,
  `verified_libs/vstd_extra`, `verified_libs/bitflags`,
  `verified_libs/ostd-pod`, and `ostd/libs/align_ext` only when imported or
  implicated by a verification failure.
- Use `tools/verus/source/vstd` as the standard-library proof fallback when local
  helpers are insufficient.

## External API Boundaries

For a missing `std`, `core`, or `alloc` contract, follow
`std-external-specifications.md` before applying these placement conventions.

Place reusable external API specifications in
`verified_libs/vstd_extra/src/external/<topic>.rs` and re-export them through the
`external` module. Do not place an ad hoc assumption beside an OSTD caller.

PR #699's `range_alloc` proof and the B-tree specifications split into PR #704
are the model for this separation: keep the OSTD caller on the original
standard-library API, place missing specifications and reusable models under
`vstd_extra::external`, and import the relevant broadcast axiom group at the
caller only when needed. Inspect the current files rather than copying the
historical diff, because vstd coverage and Rust APIs may have changed.

For each retained external helper, check that `requires` states the caller's
safety obligations and `ensures` exposes the semantic facts callers use. Moving
an unconstrained contract under `external/` centralizes it but does not justify it.

When removing `external_body`, trace standard-library atomics, unsafe calls, raw
pointers, and other opaque side effects to their active `assume_specification` or
external contract. A checked tracked permission update does not verify the
runtime operation. Record the residual boundary in evaluation and semantic-audit
results even when `make` passes.

## Project Proof Conventions

- Use `lemma_*` for proved facts and invariant preservation, and `tracked_*` for
  helpers that create or update tracked state.
- Declare proof-only model types and fields explicitly as `ghost` or `tracked`.
  Review all-ghost tracked structs as possible ghost/spec-state designs.
- Return all-tracked proof tuple components directly rather than wrapping every
  component in `Tracked<_>`; retain wrappers at exec or mixed-mode boundaries.
- Preserve the documented direction and upstream API shape of roundtrip
  definitions and verified-library mirrors such as `bitflags`.
- Avoid `Set::new_assuming_finite` and warning-suppression attributes as proof
  workarounds. Prefer reviewed spec-library construction patterns.
- Put newly added `vstd`/Verus imports before imports inherited from the original
  Rust source and keep the groups visually separate.
- Keep adjacent verified items in one `verus!` block when no non-Verus item
  separates them.
- Preserve the original executable API and data flow. For example, retain
  `range.len()` and repair proof ownership instead of reconstructing the value or
  adding an executable `clone()` solely for proof convenience.
- Run redundant-assert cleanup, `make`, `make fmt`, and the postprocess checks
  before finalizing proof-sensitive changes or a proof PR.

## Historical Classification Examples

Use history as evidence for a proof shape or boundary classification, never as
permission to copy `assume`, `admit`, or `external_body`.

- Page-table arithmetic and finite-set freshness facts are Class A and should be
  checked lemmas when their statements are mathematical.
- Entry-owner tracked constructors are Class B and should normally become direct
  proof constructors after ghost/tracked mode repair.
- Ghost-tree positivity and page-table configuration facts are Class C when they
  follow from validity predicates, constructors, or trait obligations.
- `kvirt_alloc_range_bounds` is a Class D example because it connects an
  uninterpreted allocator model to an external runtime allocator.
- `axiom_kernel_range_valid` is a Class D example when it bridges architecture
  constants and page-table bounds that the current model does not establish.
- `perm_u64_with_value` is a Class D example when its permission depends on
  opaque `vstd::atomic` view state.

Recheck every historical classification against current source and call sites.
A prior trusted boundary may become provable after the model or library changes.
