Add Verus specification scaffolding to a target file and iterate with verification until the file becomes a stronger proof-ready baseline.

Preferred invocation:

```text
$kverus-spec target=path/to/entry.rs verify="<verification command>" knowledge="<related knowledge>"
```

If either `target` or `verify` is missing, ask for the missing value and stop.

If `knowledge` is missing, continue without it.

## Shared Verus References

Read `../kverus-common/references/verus-syntax-quickref.md` before annotating executable functions or loops. For other Verus syntax, modes, loop invariants, `decreases`, `recommends`, ghost/tracked values, or spec/proof helper patterns, read the relevant shared reference before editing.

## Objective

Add only the specification structure needed to improve proof readiness of the target file.

Prefer `#[verus_spec(...)]` for new executable-function contracts and supported
loop annotations. Use `verus!` for spec/proof helpers and constructs that the
active Verus attribute syntax cannot express.

Focus on:

1. `requires`
2. `ensures`
3. loop invariants
4. `decreases`
5. `recommends`
6. `spec fn`
7. ghost/spec helper declarations

Do not focus on finishing proofs.

## Important Clarification

The goal is NOT to fully prove the code.

The goal is to improve the specification layer while preserving executable behavior and preparing the file for a later proof-generation stage.

## Hard Constraints

1. In-place edits only: edit the target file in place.
2. Preserve behavior: do not rewrite executable logic unless a tiny local change is required to express a valid specification.
3. Spec-only bias: prefer adding or refining specifications over adding proof steps.
4. Avoid introducing `assert(... ) by (...)`, `calc!`, new proof lemmas, or proof bodies unless the file would otherwise become syntactically invalid.
5. No unsound shortcuts: do not add `assume`, `admit`, or `#[verifier::external_body]`.
6. Preserve source structure as much as possible: item order, function order, impl/block structure, comments, and source locality.

## Working Style

1. Inspect the target file.
2. Use `knowledge` when relevant.
3. Make minimal edits.
4. Run the verification command after meaningful changes.
5. Use verification results to guide small follow-up edits.

## Output Expectations

Apply edits directly to the target file.

Do not return explanations unless requested.
